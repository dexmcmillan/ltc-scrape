long-term care home residents, families, staff and other community members — to provide their opinions on a proposed licensing transaction relating to a long-term care home.</p><p>As part of the ministry's review, the Director under the <cite><cite><a href=\"/laws/statute/21f39\">Fixing Long-Term Care Act, 2021</a></cite></cite> will consider submissions before making a final
